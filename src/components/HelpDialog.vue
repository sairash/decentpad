            <p class="mb-3">I've been writing blogs for a while and wanted to create something that would make it easier for me to write. Sometimes, I just want to jot down random thoughts without needing to save them. Yes, I know I could use an app, but I'm usually on the browser and have used other random websites for this. However, I couldn't trust those sites not to track me or do anything shady, so I decided to make my own. I built this website in just a few days, so there might be some things missing or it might not be the most efficient. You can help improve it by opening a PR ðŸ˜‰.</p>
